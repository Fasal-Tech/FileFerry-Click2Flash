What is "FileFerry-Click2Flash"?
--------------------------------
In it's simplest form, the "FileFerry-Click2Flash" is a low cost, portable, hardware jig that you can use to flash any external SPI flash IC (like the W25Q64JVSSIQ).
You can transfer data in one of two ways:
a. Store your file/data in the onboard micro SD card. (Example: Production firmware images, common security tokens / certificates, etc.)
b. Transfer the files from an external computer over UART using the X-modem protocol. (Example: Device specific unique keys, device specific CA certificates, UUID tokens, etc.)
You can do all of this at a click of the onboard button.

üöÄ Why is "FileFerry-Click2Flash" Needed? üõ†Ô∏è
---------------------------------------------
In today's fast-paced manufacturing environment, the need for efficient, reliable, and cost-effective tools is paramount. Traditional methods of programming SPI flash ICs, such as using J-link SPI programmers or bed-of-nails jigs, often involve expensive, bulky, and complex setups that are not easily adaptable to different production scenarios. üòì

This is where FileFerry-Click2Flash comes in! üéâ It addresses the gap between high-cost, inflexible tools and the need for a versatile, portable, and user-friendly solution. Whether you are flashing firmware or transferring security credentials, or unique device identifiers, FileFerry-Click2Flash offers an ultra-low-cost alternative that is not only easy to use but also highly customizable. The ability to transfer files via an onboard SD card or over UART using the X-modem protocol provides flexibility in various production environments, making it a robust and indispensable tool for manufacturers, developers, and technicians alike. ‚öôÔ∏èüíª

With its customizable connector interface and portable design, this tool simplifies the flashing process, reducing both the time and costs associated with traditional methods. FileFerry-Click2Flash is the modern solution to the challenges faced in programming SPI flash ICs, ensuring that the process is as seamless and efficient as possible. üñäÔ∏èüí°

There are two ways (currently supported) to transfer files to the target SPI Flash
a. Using the onboard micro SD card (Files need to be on the SD card)
b. Using a PC client over USB (you will need a Software client to initiate transfer)
